Since there is a problem deploying this app, I will provide some instructions to view this app.

1. Clone this branch. Run `git clone https://github.com/ChandlerNgo/HangmanRepo.git` into the command prompt to the location of where you want the repo to be
2. Create a virtual machine. Run `python -m venv HangmanVirtualMachine` in the same folder to create the virtual machine. Run `HangmanVirtualMachine\Scripts\activate.bat` afterwards to activate the virtual machine.
3. Run the server. Run `py manage.py runserver` to start the server.
4. Open [Hangman](http://127.0.0.1:8000/HangmanApp) in the browser to view the Hangman App!
